-This is not intended to be used in machine learning projects (yet)
-I made this project to demonstrate my basic skills in algorithms & OOP
- methods are well documented for readers.
- this project has currently the implementation of the k-means algorithm (kmean++) only and updates are expected.

Knowledge applied :
-Data Structures & algorithms
-recursions
- Object oriented programming : Inheritence & polymorphism & interfaces and callbacks ...
- Builder Design pattern.
-Exception handeling.


i'll soon add Junit tests since i have made this before learning how to implement unit tests.
